# Flickr-Photo-Plotter
Final Project For the FEND NanoDegree at Udacity



## Application Overview

This single page application displays a map (Google Maps) and a list of landmarks (currently the landmarks are monstly Dodecanese islands of Greece plus Santorini and Delos - which are too cool to ignore :P ). The user can filter the landmarks by using the input field above the marker list. By clicking on either the marker on the map or the list item at the list of markers an infoWindow will expand above the marker on the map. **By default the info window displays the following information:**
* A brief description of the landmark (fetched from the Wikipedia API)
* A thumbnail of a random photograph (fetched from the Flickr API)
    * By clicking on the thumbnail in the infowindow a modal window will open that displays the the large version of the photo. 
* A button that if pressed will plot (create a new marker with the photo's details ) the photograph on the map
